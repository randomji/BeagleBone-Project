1. Login the BeagleBone Black with root

2. Enter the command: iwconfig 
   - It will show you a list of extension. 
   - If wlan0 is not shown, power off the BeagleBone Black and power on. (The USB might be wlan2 or 3, edit wlan0 accordingly to your USB shown)

3. Enter the command: nano /etc/network/interfaces
   - As we are only using wlan0, look for #Wifi-Example

3. Under the #Wifi-Example, edit the wpa-ssid (name of wifi) and wpa-psk (password)
   - This will enable the BeableBone Black to search for the wifi
   - To disable the wlan0, use # to comment it.

4. Save the file using Ctrl + 0 to overwrite it.

5. If you're unable to connect to the wifi, enter the command: 
   ifup wlan0
   ifdown wlan0
   - This will allow the USB adapter to restart and start to scan for the fixed wifi and connect.
